## Overview

This application is a matching game themed around World of Warcraft characters. Test your memory skills and see if you can guess 12 in a row!

Deployed at: https://caleblmyers.github.io/memory-game/

## Description

The game board is filled with 12 different images. The objective of the game is to select all 12 characters in a row, without repeating any selections.

When an image is clicked that has not been selected yet, the user's score is increased by 1.

If an image is clicked that has been selected, the user's score is reset to 0.

Every time an image is clicked the board is shuffled so the order of images is different. This raises the difficulty and really tests your memory!
